I see it all. Google makes it hard to figure out how to add custom button especially with the new mid 2021 API release removing the whole nice old platform.js library. Well how do I get the new Sign in API to work

 - Step 1: Add button-code.html to your website (avaliable in Github repository)
 - Step 2: Style the button
 - Step 3: Prrocess the information retrieved from button code given to you
 - Step 4: Sign in/up the user
 
 Its that easy to use.
